* This template follows the suggestions from [keepachangelog](http://keepachangelog.com/). Please see that site or its [Github repo](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog) for a thorough explanation.
* What's the "Unreleased" section for?
    * It is meant to minimize effort.
    * People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
    * At release time, you just have to change `"Unreleased"` to the version number
    and add a new `"Unreleased"` header at the top.
* What about yanked releases?
    * Yanked releases are versions that had to be pulled because of a serious bug or security issue. Often these versions don't even appear in change logs. Here is a suggested way to include them:
    * `## 0.0.5 - 2014-12-13 [YANKED]`
